Allows BuddyPress administrators to block users indefinitely, or for a specified period of time.

== Description ==

>This plugin requires BuddyPress 2.1.2+.

Spamming and deleting users in BuddyPress both destructive actions, leaving little to no trace that the user existed. Sometimes a user needs a period of time to let cooler heads prevail. BP Block Users allows a capable user (administrators only by default) to block a user from logging into the site. The block can be applied for a specified period of time, or indefinitely, if administrators need more time to determine the best course of action.

A message will be shown on the login screen when a blocked user attempts, but ultimately fails, to login, informing them that their account has been blocked. During the block period, email notifications are suspended.
